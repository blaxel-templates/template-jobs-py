## ‚ú® Features

- Scalable batch job processing with structured data handling
- Support for both local and production execution modes
- Flexible input methods (batch files, direct data, command line)
- Built on Blaxel platform for efficient job orchestration
- Error handling and logging for production reliability
- Easy deployment and monitoring through Blaxel platform
- Sample batch files and configuration templates

## üöÄ Quick Start

For those who want to get up and running quickly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-jobs-py.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd template-jobs-py

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the job locally with sample data
bl run job my-job --local --file batches/sample-batch.json

# Deploy to production
bl deploy
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.10 or later
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust
- **Blaxel Platform Setup:** Complete Blaxel setup by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started#quickstart)
  - **[Blaxel CLI](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started):** Ensure you have the Blaxel CLI installed. If not, install it globally:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
    ```
  - **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel platform
    ```bash
    bl login YOUR-WORKSPACE
    ```

## üíª Installation

**Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-jobs-py.git
cd template-jobs-py
uv sync
```

## üîß Usage

### Running the Job Locally

Test your job locally using different input methods:

```bash
# Run with a sample batch file
bl run job my-job --local --file batches/sample-batch.json

# Run with direct data input
bl run job my-job --local --data '{"tasks": [{"name": "John"}]}'

# Run without Blaxel CLI (direct Python execution)
python src/main.py --name John
```

### Testing your job

You can test your job with various input scenarios:

```bash
# Test with different batch sizes
bl run job my-job --local --data '{"tasks": [{"name": "Alice"}, {"name": "Bob"}, {"name": "Charlie"}]}'

# Test error handling
bl run job my-job --local --data '{"tasks": [{"invalid": "data"}]}'
```

### Deploying to Blaxel

When you are ready to deploy your job:

```bash
bl deploy
```

After deployment, run the job in production:

```bash
# Run with a batch file in production
bl run job my-job --file batches/sample-batch.json

# Run with direct data in production
bl run job my-job --data '{"tasks": [{"name": "John"}]}'
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **src/main.py** - Job entry point and main execution logic
- **batches/** - Sample batch files for testing and examples
  - **sample-batch.json** - Example batch configuration
- **pyproject.toml** - UV package manager configuration
- **blaxel.toml** - Blaxel deployment configuration

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blaxel Platform Issues**:
   - Ensure you're logged in to your workspace: `bl login MY-WORKSPACE`
   - Verify models are available: `bl get models`
   - Check that functions exist: `bl get functions`

2. **Job Execution Failures**:
   - Check input data format matches expected schema
   - Verify batch file JSON syntax is valid
   - Monitor job execution logs for error details

3. **Data Processing Issues**:
   - Ensure task data contains required fields
   - Check for data type mismatches in input
   - Verify output format meets requirements

4. **Performance and Scaling**:
   - Monitor job execution time for large batches
   - Consider batch size optimization for efficiency
   - Check memory usage during data processing

5. **Deployment Problems**:
   - Verify blaxel.toml configuration is correct
   - Check job naming conflicts in workspace
   - Ensure proper permissions for job execution
